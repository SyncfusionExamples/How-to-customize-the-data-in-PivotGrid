# Essential JS 2 QuickStart

## Installing

We can get all the Essential JS 2 components in a single npm package [`ej2`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@syncfusion/ej2).

We already configure the required packages in the `package.json` file.

You can run the below command to install all dependent packages related to this seed project.

```
npm install
```

## Running

The application is configured with `browser-sync`, so it will serve the web application in your default browser.

We used `SystemJS` for module loading.

You can use the below npm script to run the web application.

```
npm start
```
